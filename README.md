# ThompsonSampling
Thompson Sampling (Posterior Sampling or Probability Matching) is an algorithm for choosing the actions that address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in multi-armed bandit problem. Actions are performed several times and are called exploration. It uses training information that evaluates the actions taken rather than instructs by giving correct actions. This is what creates the need for active exploration, for an explicit trial-and-error search for good behaviour. Based on the results of those actions, rewards (1) or penalties (0) are given for that action to the machine. Further actions are performed in order to maximize the reward that may improve future performance
